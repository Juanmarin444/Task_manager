# Tools that helped me


This web app was created with **Django** and **SQLite** and deployed with **Heroku**.

## Django

*Django* is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)

### Validations
This web app features custom made form validation implemented in with the **UserManager** model.
The model contains three separate **validation function** used through out the application.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/Juanmarin444/Task_manager/blob/main/apps/users_tasks/models.py).

### Bcrypt
**Bcrypt** allows building a password security platform that can evolve alongside hardware technology to guard against the threats that the future may bring.
Each user's password is hashed before registering it in the database so that it can be authenticated later when the user wishes to log in. 
Bcrypt is easy to implement in Python and JavaScript projects.
